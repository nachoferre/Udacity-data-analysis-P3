# Udacity-data-analysis-P3
The project I am going to develop its about auditing, cleaning and enhancing a dataset containing a region of the world of my choice. In my case I decided to work with my hometown Madrid. The file is 600MBs. The size of the file has posed a problem during the realization of the project, that is why in the last parts of the project we have reduced the size of the dataset we will be working on. The project is going to have three specific parts:

* Auditing our data : in here we will look all over our data to find where can it be enhanced or fixed
* Treating/Enhancing data : the enhancements and fixes found in the previous part will be applied here
* Analyzing our data : Once we have our data stored in the main database In each of them we will be applying the different concepts we have learned during the course as well as applying different previous knowledge. First we are going to reproduce the quizzes we made during the mongodb case study. We are going to use this quiz to start improving the dataset
