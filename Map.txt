I coose this dataset for to main reasons:
* It had potential to be audited and enhanced, thanks to some previous work before choosing.
* It is my hometown
* I though it could be a good challenge to face things like encoding or street types up front.

Madrid is the capital os Spain. It is a big city with multiple districts and a lot of potential. The area I choose no only comprehends Madrid as a sole city but it includes some near neuighboorhods as well. They are all part of the Autonomous Community os Madrid. I thought it could be interesting to enhance data related to things or places wich I go through every morning.
